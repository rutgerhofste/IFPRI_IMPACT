| Area                         | Represents harvested area, which is the total area planted and harvested within a year, and may include multicropping or multiple harvests and differ from total arable land or reported physical area | The total cropland supply grows over time driven by exogenous trends on the availability of area for agriculture as well as endogenous responses to changes in area demand. Each year, the amount of total crop area is fixed, and it is efficiently allocated to different crops based on crop area demand, a function of crop price, and the price of land.                                                                                                                          | thousand hectares | national, FPU†, SPAM* | FAOSTAT commodity balances                   |

Land used for crop production is divided into irrigated and rainfed systems, capturing the significant differences in yields observed across these cultivation systems and linking directly with the water models, which treat irrigated and rainfed water supplies separately. Production is the product of area and yield, with national production equal to the summation of individual FPU production. | thousand mts      | national, FPU†, SPAM* | calculated                                   |
